 # Question 2
 
 Fascinated by the snowfall at Lakefield College School, you resolve to write an augmented-reality app that will use a phone's camera, and time-lapse photography, to track snowfall amounts for each day.
 
 ![snowfallatlcs](snowfallatlcs.png "Having fun with snow at LCS")
 
 The following pieces of information will be tracked each hour:
 
 * date of this measurement
 * time of this measurement
 * current height of snow outside window in centimetres
 
 Additionally, the app will keep track of, overall:
 
 * total snowfall over entire year so far
 
 For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).
 
 Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.

// Answer question 2 below
var date = 19
var time = 9.06
var HeightOfSnow = 10.0
var totalSnowfall = 120.0
print("I chose to use a variable because the number will change, like the height of the snow, the total snow fall, the date, and the time when you measured the snow.You took the picture from night to the dawn, so the time must be changed, and the amount of the snow won't be the same as before. Thus, I use variable.")
